Abstraction is the concept of object-oriented programming that “shows” only essential attributes and “hides” unnecessary information.
The main purpose of abstraction is hiding the unnecessary details from the users.
Abstraction is selecting data from a larger pool to show only relevant details of the object to the user.
It helps in reducing programming complexity and efforts.
It is one of the most important concepts of OOPs.

Abstraction in python is defined as hiding the implementation of logic from the client and using the particular application.
It hides the irrelevant data specified in the project, reducing complexity and giving value to the efficiency.
Abstraction is made in Python using Abstract classes and their methods in the code.

Abstract Class is a type of class in OOPs, that declare one or more abstract methods.
These classes can have abstract methods as well as concrete methods.
A normal class cannot have abstract methods.
An abstract class is a class that contains at least one abstract method.
" ] }, { "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": [ "## What are Abstract Methods?\n", "
Abstract Method is a method that has just the method definition but does not contain implementation.
A method without a body is known as an Abstract Method.
It must be declared in an abstract class.
The abstract method will never be final because the abstract class must implement all the abstract methods.
" ] }, { "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": [ "## When to use Abstract Methods & Abstract Class?\n", "
Abstract methods are mostly declared where two or more subclasses are also doing the same thing in different ways through different implementations.
It also extends the same Abstract class and offers different implementations of the abstract methods.
Abstract classes help to describe generic types of behaviors and object-oriented programming class hierarchy.
It also describes subclasses to offer implementation details of the abstract class.

Abstraction	Encapsulation
Abstraction in Object Oriented Programming solves the issues at the design level.	Encapsulation solves it implementation level.
Abstraction in Programming is about hiding unwanted details while showing most essential information.	Encapsulation means binding the code and data into a single unit.
Data Abstraction in Java allows focussing on what the information object must contain	Encapsulation means hiding the internal details or mechanics of how an object does something for security reasons.

The main benefit of using an Abstraction in Programming is that it allows you to group several related classes as siblings.

" ] }, { "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": [ "## How Abstract Base classes work : \n", "
By default, Python does not provide abstract classes. Python comes with a module that provides the base for defining Abstract Base classes(ABC) and that module name is ABC.
ABC works by decorating methods of the base class as abstract and then registering concrete classes as implementations of the abstract base.
A method becomes abstract when decorated with the keyword @abstractmethod.
