//Simple interest

Step one:
Break down the problem by expanding the brackets.

<!--Inference-->

The formula thats given can simply be defined as:

(P * R * T)/100

#This is a much easier code to write.



Psuedocode:


let p = principal

let r = rate (Percentage*)

let t = time

let SI = (P * R * T)/100

print SI




//compound interest


let p = principal

let r = rate (Percentage*)

let t = time


let CI = P * ((1 + (R / 100)) ** T - 1)

print CI


//annuity plan


PMT: periodic payment

let p = principal

let r = rate (Percentage*)

let t = time


let AP = PMT * (1 - (1 + R / n) ** (-n * T)) / (R / n)

print AP
